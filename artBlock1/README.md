Youtube video link: https://youtu.be/iZBlX8bbYko
Application, ArtBlock, was built using XCode(version 13.1) and using SwiftUI

How to run: 
 1. Open XCode (most udpated version)
 2. Click on the file "artBlock1.xcodeproj" 
    a. if asked to verify safety, click "OK"
 3. Once the file is loaded into XCode, to the right of the app title (middle of page) there should be a light gray arrow and a device. 
 4. Click on the device and switch to "iPhone 11"
 5. Then, click the triangle play button in the top left to run the simulator. 
 
 
 How to use different functionalities: 
 1. To start: 
    This application is saved and based on the user's device, so no logging in is necessary. Simply let the app download on your simulator, and
    it should launch to the Home page.
 2. The Home Page: 
    This page is the best place to start looking at your options as a user. You can see there are three sections (scroll vertically to see all 3) including: Ideas, Progress, and Gallery). These three sections match with the three tab bar options on the bottom. However, the Home Page is made for the user to quickly be able to access the most recent updates in these sections. Scroll horizontally through these sections to see the 3 most relevant options, and click to see more details. 
    While the Home Page allows you to get a snapshot of the important projects, using the Tab Bar allows users to focus specifically on ideas, progress, or their gallery.
    Something to note: The navigation bar items at the very top (magnifying glass and shopping cart) are at this moment simply for decoration, but would be later made actionable in later iterations.
    
 3. The Ideas Page: access by clicking on the lighbulb icon on the bottom toolbar from any page
    This page Starts out rather basic with a list of the main idea groups you have. You can create a new idea group by clicking the document with a plus badge button on the lower left corner above the tab controls. This pulls up a overlay that asks you for a new project name. Click on the text field, type a new name, and click save to complete the action. Alternatively, if you decide not to add a new project, click the cancel button to dismisss the overlay. 
    From this stage, click on one of the projects (for example the preloaded Project 1) to see the ideas related to this project. To show user function, there are two ideas already loaded into these projects. Add your own by clicking in the text field below the project name and to the left of "Add new" where it says "Enter new idea." Type your new idea, and click the blue "Add new" button to complete. Your idea should populate below the examples. 
    If you would like to move or delete your ideas, this can be done by clicking the edit button, and moving the ideas with the three bars or  deleting by clicking the red minus sign and hitting the red delete. Alternatively, you can always press down on an idea and swipe left to remove it. 

 4. The Progress Page: access by clicking on the timer icon on the bottom toolbar
    This page has a vertical scrolling feature showing all of your current projects including the image of the piece and the name of the piece below it. When you click on these colored squares containing the image, you see the update progress page. Here you can add new progress on each piece by typing in the "Add New Progress Here..." text field and then hitting the blue save button. We have preloaded the example progress post "Updated drawings." To go back to other projects in progress, simply hit the blue progress back button at the top.
    At the very bottom, we have the option to add a new piece. Despite my best efforts, this does not link to a similar progress page, but I hope in the future this would be possible. For the moment, you can upload your own image and set a name. First, set a name for the new piece by clicking on the "Write Item Name Here" text field below "New Item Name." Then, delete the placeholder text, and write the title of the piece. When you hit the save button below this field, this new text should appear instead of the "New item name" below the image. However, the save button can be a bit glitchy, so try clicking around it if it does not work immediately. After setting a title, upload your image by clicking on the gray rectangle and selecting a photo from your camera roll. 
    
    5. The Gallery Page: access by clicking on the person icon on the bottom toolbar
    This page is where user's would display all of their finished work. For examples I used my own work. Scroll to see all of the items. If you click on a piece, you will see the details about it including materials, size, and when it was last updated. Similar to the progress page, at the bottom of the scroll view, there is a place to put a new finished item. Like the progress page, this sadly does not update to a finished work page yet. To use this feature follow these steps from the above text: "For the moment, you can upload your own image and set a name. First, set a name for the new piece by clicking on the "Write Item Name Here" text field below "New Item Name." Then, delete the placeholder text, and write the title of the piece. When you hit the save button below this field, this new text should appear instead of the "New item name" below the image. However, the save button can be a bit glitchy, so try clicking around it if it does not work immediately. After setting a title, upload your image by clicking on the gray rectangle and selecting a photo from your camera roll. "
